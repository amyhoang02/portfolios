## Google Merchandise Store

My goal of this project is providing a 360-degree of E-commerce retail KPIs dashboard with handy filters to quickly automate different monthly/yearly metrics ***(average page-view, bounce rate per page, traffic per location)***.

#### **Technical Highlights:**

- Wildcard to 'union' GA sessions
- Nested data structure: `users` > `sessions` > `hits`
- Unnest nested data to get hit level raw data
- Window functions
- Extract-transform-load (ETL) Google Analytics data in BigQuery on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

**Dynamic digital analytic dashboard:** During specific one year timeframe from 2016-08-01 to 2017-08-01, total session increase by 12.7% in March 2017 compared to
February 2017 with volume traffic via Direct source dropped by 68% in the same period.

I aimed at extracting insights of consumption trendings at different customer segmentations with RFM analysis to effectively capture high-value customer. 

First, I designed and implemented ELT pipelines on Python to clean and transform from raw database into equivalent data types. Then, to identify **churn rate** (at 1.25%) and forecast COA that effectively support Retention and Acquisition team, I calculated marketing KPIs such as **Conversion rate, Response rate, Retention rate**. 
Next, in order to showcase the relationship between Income and Amount Spending, I plotted these two attributes to validate my assumption. I also performed Heatmap to indicate the correlation between each attribute.

My main concentration on this project were conducting ELT and EDA to visualize business insights such as number of loyalty customer versus regular customer, sale volume at each brand **(Naypyidaw 32.8% & Mandalay 33.2%)**. In order to reduce COGS **(interchange cost)**, I performed the payment method analysis to backup my proposal **(credit card method dropped at 31.1%).**

-	Calculated **credit-to-income ratio, average income, numbers of bad debt and refused accounts, etc.** for 300,000 records using SQL.
-	Prepared data by removing empty records and imputing missing values, and identified features correlated to defaulted accounts.
-	Transformed categorical variables into dummy variables using one-hot encoding.
-	Implemented and compared Logistic Regression and Random Forest models, the performance of the later method was improved by 17%.
