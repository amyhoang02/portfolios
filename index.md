## Google Merchandise Store 

### *Tableau, Google Analytics, Google BigQuery*

My goal of this project is providing a 360-degree of E-commerce retail KPIs dashboard with handy filters to quickly automate different monthly/yearly metrics ***(average page-view, bounce rate per page, traffic per location)***.

#### **Technical Highlights:**

- Wildcard to 'union' GA sessions
- Nested data structure: `users` > `sessions` > `hits`
- Unnest nested data to get hit level raw data
- Window functions
- Extract-transform-load (ETL) Google Analytics data in BigQuery on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

**Dynamic digital analytic dashboard:** During specific one year timeframe from 2016-08-01 to 2017-08-01, total session increase by 12.7% in March 2017 compared to
February 2017 with volume traffic via Direct source dropped by 68% in the same period.
